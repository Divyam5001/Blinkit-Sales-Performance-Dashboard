# Blinkit-Sales-Performance-Dashboard
This project was all about understanding Blinkit's sales trends and outlet performance,I cleaned the data using SPSS, handled missing values, and selected key factors. Then, I defined KPIs, built interactive dashboards, and verified insights using SQL. This project transformed raw data into meaningful business insights.

Steps

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Performed missing data analysis using SPSS to handle incomplete records.
Identified and retained only the most useful factors relevant to sales and performance.

2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Selection:

Defined crucial metrics such as Total Sales, Average Sales, Item Visibility, and Outlet Performance.
Segmented data based on factors like Outlet Type, Fat Content, and Location.

3. Dashboard Development:

Designed interactive dashboards to visualize sales trends, category-wise sales, and outlet insights.
Implemented bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for better data representation.

4. SQL-Based Validation:

Verified the accuracy of dashboard insights by running SQL queries for data aggregation, grouping, and filtering.
Ensured consistency between the dashboard and raw data calculations.
