# Blinkit-Sales-Performance-Dashboard
This project was all about understanding Blinkit's sales trends and outlet performance,I cleaned the data using SPSS, handled missing values, and selected key factors. Then, I defined KPIs, built interactive dashboards, and verified insights using SQL. This project transformed raw data into meaningful business insights.
